# Rampart Nexus

Rampart Nexus is an opensource tool for automating security compliance designed to integrate multiple frameworks (CIS, NIST, ISO, etc) and scanners to provide a unified interface for security audits or assessments. The tool allows users to run scans, normalize results, map controls, and generate reports.

## Features (TO BE IMPLEMENTED)

- **Multi-Scanner Integration**: Supports various scanners such as Prowler (Cloud Providers), Trivy(Containers), and OpenSCAP(Windows/Linux).
- **Unified Data Schema**: Normalizes outputs from different scanners into a single schema for easier analysis.
- **Control Mapping**: Maps controls from different frameworks to a single control for streamlined checks.
- **Reporting**: Generates reports in multiple formats such as CSV, PDF, JSON, and HTML.
- **Remediation Tools**: Inbuilt remediation capabilities to fix controls and provide reccomendations.
